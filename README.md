# Reinforcement-learning (RL) for fine-tuning
This repository documents my understanding of reinforcement learning. Following is an ongoing list of topics I have covered so far:

1. Implemented of REINFORCE algorithm and applied to cartpole gym environment. For further improvements in policy estimates implemented REINFORCE with baseline, actor-critic, and proximal policy optimization approaches.

2. Read Cristiano et al. to understand the differences between classical RL and RL for tasks where preferences/rewards are available over a trajectory rather than for each action in classical RL.

3. Using `HuggingFace` library fine-tuned GPT2 model with DPO algorithm using HH-RLHF dataset. Implemented training and evaluation pipelines.
